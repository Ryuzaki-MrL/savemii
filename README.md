# SaveMii Wut Port

Original by Ryuzaki-MrL WUT Port by me

WiiU/vWii Save Manager

This homebrew allows you to backup your Wii U and vWii savegames to the SD card and also restore them. Up to 256 backups
can be made per title. Backups are stored in sd:/wiiu/backups.

For sorting Titles press R to change sorting method and press L to change between descending and ascending.

Use it at your own risk and please report any issues that may occur.

Reasons to use this over original mod:

- Faster copy speeds
- VC injects are shown
- If VC is vWii, the user is warned to go to the vWii saves section instead
- Demo support
- Fixes issues present in the mod version
- Shows useful info about the saves like its date and time of creation
